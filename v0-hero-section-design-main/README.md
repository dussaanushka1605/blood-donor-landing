## 📝 Vercel v0 Usage Notes

The following components and sections were built using **Vercel v0**:

2. **Features Section**: The three-column features grid with icon cards, hover effects, and responsive design was created using v0. Each feature card includes an icon, title, and description with consistent styling.

3. **Testimonials Section**: The testimonials grid with profile images, feedback quotes, and role information was generated using v0. The section maintains visual consistency with the rest of the design.

4. **Contact Section**: The contact form with proper input fields, labels, and styling was built using v0. The form includes name, email, and message fields with focus states and proper accessibility.
